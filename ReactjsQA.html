*********************Basics*****************************

1. What is React?
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.

2. What are the features of React?
Virtual DOM, component-based architecture, JSX, unidirectional data flow, fast rendering.

3. What is JSX?
JavaScript syntax extension that allows HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

4. What is DOM?
Document Object Model; it represents the page structure as nodes and objects.

5. What is Virtual DOM?
A lightweight copy of the real DOM, updated in memory first, improving performance.

6. What is state in ReactJS?
A built-in object used to store dynamic data and trigger UI updates.

<strong>Objective</strong>: Understand how state is used in React to store and manage dynamic data.

<strong>Counter App:</strong>
<code>
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;

</code>


7. What are props?
Short for properties; props are read-only data passed from parent to child components.

Objective: Understand how data is passed between components using props.

import React from "react";

const Greeting = ({ name, age }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>You are {age} years old.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return <Greeting name="John" age={25} />;
};

export default App;



8. Differences between State and Props?
Props are passed, immutable; State is local, mutable.

9. What are keys in React?
Unique identifiers used to help React efficiently update lists of elements.

Objective: Understand the importance of keys in lists to help React identify which items have changed.

const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
const FruitList = () => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

10. What is context in React?
A way to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level.

Objective: Learn how to pass data through the component tree without props drilling.

Exercise:

    Create a context for managing the theme (light or dark) and consume it in a child component.


import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from "react";

// Create Context
const ThemeContext = createContext();

const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};

const ThemeToggle = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Current Theme: {theme}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <ThemeToggle />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

export default App;


************* Components *************************

11. What is the component life cycle of a React class component?
Mounting ‚Üí Updating ‚Üí Unmounting (methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount).

12. What are fragments in React?
A way to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM (<>...</>).

13. What are synthetic events in React?
React's cross-browser wrapper around the native browser event.

14. What are Pure components in React?
Components that only re-render when their props or state change shallowly.

15. What are Refs in React?
References to directly access DOM elements or React elements.

16. What is forwardRef?
Passing a ref through a component to one of its child DOM nodes.

17. What are Error boundaries?
Components that catch JavaScript errors in their children and display a fallback UI.

18. What are Higher Order Components (HOCs)?
Functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced behavior.

19. Differences between controlled and uncontrolled components?
Controlled components manage their state via React; uncontrolled components use the DOM.

20. What are Portals in React?
A way to render children into a DOM node outside the parent component hierarchy.

21. What are render props in React?
A technique where a component‚Äôs child is a function, allowing dynamic rendering.
ü™ù Hooks

22. What is useMemo?
Memoizes a value to avoid expensive calculations on every render.

23. What is useCallback?
Memoizes a function to prevent it from being recreated on every render.

24. Differences between useMemo and useCallback?
useMemo caches a value; useCallback caches a function.

25. What are custom hooks?
Reusable functions that start with use and share logic between components.

26. What is useReducer hook?
An alternative to useState, more suited for complex state logic.

27. Which lifecycle hooks are replaced with useEffect?
componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

28. When to use useState and useReducer?
Use useState for simple state, useReducer for complex or related state transitions.

29. What are the different hooks you have used?
Common: useState, useEffect, useContext, useMemo, useRef, useCallback, useReducer.

*************Advanced Topics****************************

30. Difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
package.json manages project dependencies; package-lock.json locks dependency versions for consistency.

31. Client-side vs Server-side rendering?
Client-side: Rendered in the browser; Server-side: Rendered on the server, faster initial load.

32. What is props drilling?
Passing data through multiple levels of components manually.

33. Disadvantages of props drilling and how to avoid?
Hard to maintain; avoid with Context API or state management libraries.

34. What is Lazy loading in React?
Loading components only when needed, improving performance.

35. What is Suspense in React?
A component that waits for something (like lazy-loaded components) before rendering fallback UI.

36. Example of Context API usage?
Provide a theme or user authentication data throughout the app.

37. Context API vs Redux?
Context is simpler for small apps; Redux is more scalable for large applications.

38. PropTypes in React?
Library for validating types of props passed to components.

39. Differences between createElement and cloneElement?
createElement creates a new element; cloneElement clones an existing one and can modify its props.

40. What are protected routes in React?
Routes that require user authentication to access.

41. What is react-router has context menu?
React Router uses context internally to provide navigation features across the app.
üõ†Ô∏è Practical Questions

42. Purpose of callback function as an argument of setState()?
To ensure the state is updated based on previous state reliably.

43. Create a custom hook for increment/decrement counter?
Use useState internally in a hook returning increment and decrement functions.

44. How to send data from child to parent using callback functions?
Pass a function from parent to child, then call it inside the child with data.

45. How to send data from child component to parent using useRef?
Assign refs in parent, and child updates it directly.

46. How do you optimize your React application?
Code splitting, memoization, lazy loading, avoiding unnecessary renders.

47. How would you consume a RESTful JSON API in ReactJS?
Using fetch or axios inside a useEffect hook.

******************Miscellaneous**********************

48. What is Strict Mode in React?
A tool for highlighting potential problems in an application.

49. Ways to pass data from child to parent in React?
Callback functions, lifting state up, refs.

50. Different design patterns used in React?
HOCs, Render Props, Compound Components, Hooks Pattern.

51. What are React Mixins?
Deprecated technique for sharing behavior between components, replaced by HOCs and hooks.

52. What are the different types of exports and imports?
Named exports/imports and default exports/imports.
